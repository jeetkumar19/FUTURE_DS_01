## 🚀 Project Overview
This project features a high-impact **Executive Sales Report** built in Power BI, designed to provide actionable business intelligence for retail stakeholders. Using the "Sample - Superstore" dataset, I transformed raw transactional data into a strategic tool that tracks KPIs, geographic profitability, and year-over-year (YoY) growth.

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### **1. Data Modeling & ETL**
* Cleaned and transformed raw CSV data using **Power Query**.
* Established a structured schema to support complex time-series analysis and geographic drill-downs.

### **2. Advanced DAX Calculations**
* **Time Intelligence:** Engineered `Sales LY` and `YoY Growth` measures to provide historical context.
* **Dynamic Indicators:** Implemented conditional logic to display **(+/- % vs LY)** status markers in KPI cards.
* **Profitability Logic:** Developed measures for **Profit Margin %** to normalize performance across varying sales volumes.

### **3. Visual Engineering & UX**
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Filled Maps** with red-to-teal gradients to instantly highlight "Bleeding" vs. "Profitable" states.
* **Executive UI:** Applied a modern design language using **rounded corners, subtle shadows, and consistent padding** to reduce cognitive load.
* **Interactive Storytelling:** Integrated slicers for **Year, Region, and Segment** to allow for multi-dimensional data exploration.

## 📈 Key Business Insights
* **Regional Optimization:** Identified that while Texas has high sales volume, it is a high-loss state, suggesting a need for discount policy revision.
* **Category Performance:** Technology leads in both revenue and profit margin, identifying it as the primary driver for business growth.
* **Seasonal Forecasting:** The "Sales vs Previous Year" trend reveals a consistent Q4 surge, providing a baseline for future inventory planning.
